# Regional air pollutant forecasting with Unidirectional Bipartite LSTM GCN
This repo introduce a me-developed structure *Unidirectional Bipartite LSTM GCN* that enables more accurate hourly air polluant forecasting with ground observation from a limited set of ground observation stations and the regional 3D model forecasting of the region.
