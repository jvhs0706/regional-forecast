# Regional air pollutant forecasting

This repository introduces a deep-learning model that makes **REGIONAL** air pollution forecasting for the future 48 hours. It combines the *ground observation* of the past 72 hours and the *WRF-CMAQ* results for the future 48 hours. The proposed constitues a variety of structures: LSTM encoder-decoders, bidirectional LSTMs, time-distributed dense layers, and a newly proposed *broadcasting layer*.
